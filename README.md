# Automated-Voting
Automatic design of voting rules using neural networks and the genetic algorithm. 

## TODO 

1. Data preprocessing
    - [x] Profile generator
    - [ ] Alternative scenarios generator
    - [ ] Universal input preprocessing (make sure matrix is properly transposed)

2. Voting methods
    - [ ] Election method - add parameters
    - [ ] Separate constraint/checks (i.e is there a condorcet winner?)

3. Neural network
    - [ ] Finish basic Keras tutorial
    - [ ] Write basic architecture for voting NN
    - [ ] Write training procedure 
    - [ ] Write input component of pipeline - make it ready for any transformation
    - [ ] Write things 
    - [ ] Loss component - fairness/sensitivity
    - [ ] Loss component - non-manipulability
    - [ ] Loss component - tests
    - [ ] Full Keras implementation/tensorflow 2.0 
    - [ ] Full Pytorch implementation

4. Genetic Algorithm
    - [x] Basic implementation 
    - [ ] Add all constraint functions
    - [ ] Make it more fancy/run experiments
