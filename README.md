# Voting Rules via Neural Networks
Automated design of voting rules using neural networks - written in order to satisfy the requirements of the honors program at Oberlin College.
Thesis and presentation included.

- Commands to run experiments for 3 candidates and 20 voters in ```Main_nC3.sh```, and 5 candidates and 40-80 voters on ```Main_nC5.sh```. 

- To generate preference profiles, run the commands at the top /automated_voting/voting/profiles.py

- To test baselines, run the commands at the top of /automated_voting/voting/election.py

- To test neural network, look into /automated_voting/algorithms/neural_network.py

- To run everything look into main.py

- Main thesis
